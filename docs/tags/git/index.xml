      <description>Since my last post almost five months ago, a lot has changed both in my personal and professional life. On a personal note, I finally moved to the beautiful and magical city of Prague, walked the famous Charles Bridge, enjoyed the clock show at the lovely Old Town Square, tried Czech dumplings, and enjoyed Kofola. Professionally, I have worked more with R&amp;rsquo;s shiny system as part of my job, learning a lot in the process.</description>

Introduction
Admittedly, it has been a long time since my last blog entry. Between that time, I have been working on a number of projects that I maintain over at my GitHub and more importantly, I was working on my final year thesis and finalizing my undergraduate studies.</description>

      <description>One of the most beautiful things about open source development is the idea that one picks up crucial skills like versioning be it via git* or any version control system of their choosing. For non developers, such versioning can be accomplished via syncing files to the cloud or manually uploading files each time. Alternatively, and in the most extreme scenario, one could simply version their files by simple file number incrementation: file_1_edit, file_1_edit_final, file_1_edit_final_final_finally.</description>

      <description>Introduction
For over two years now, I have devoted most of my time to either building open source software or alerting developers of issues with &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; software. I use their in quotes because open source software really is community software and most developers have the community&amp;rsquo;s needs first.
During this time, I have grown a lot as a developer and believe that most of this growth has come from my involvement with developer communities be it over at StackOverflow or GitHub.</description>
