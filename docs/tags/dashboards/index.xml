      <description>Since my last post almost five months ago, a lot has changed both in my personal and professional life. On a personal note, I finally moved to the beautiful and magical city of Prague, walked the famous Charles Bridge, enjoyed the clock show at the lovely Old Town Square, tried Czech dumplings, and enjoyed Kofola. Professionally, I have worked more with R&amp;rsquo;s shiny system as part of my job, learning a lot in the process.</description>

Introduction
Admittedly, it has been a long time since my last blog entry. Between that time, I have been working on a number of projects that I maintain over at my GitHub and more importantly, I was working on my final year thesis and finalizing my undergraduate studies.</description>
