      <description>TLDR: Whenever possible use vectorised alternatives instead of loops, seq_along and 1:length will be handy when looping through data.
The R vs Python debate is one that has stood the test of time. Thousands of articles and tweets have been made that aim to argue for the use of one language over another. Fortunately for the reader, this post is not aimed at justifying the use of one language.
On the contrary, as someone who is fairly proficient in both languages, I thought it would be nice to write about key differences between loops in R and python.</description>

      <description>In this short post, we take a look at how we can use pyautocv for edge detection. At the time of writing, pyautocv was at version 0.2.1 that was unreleased.
For installation details, please see the documentation of the project.
Pre-requisites
Python &amp;gt;=3.6pyautocvAn image directory for which detection is required.To begin, we import pyautocvâ€™s Segmentation class.
from pyautocv.segmentation import *Next, we change directory to the target directory that holds our images.</description>
