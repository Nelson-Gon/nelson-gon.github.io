      <description>I have recently released new versions of manymodelr and mde, R packages you may or may not have heard of.
One common feature of many R packages is a hexagon shaped sticker that often summarises the goals of the package and/or gives an idea of the developer’s philosophy. I am, as those who know me well might tell you, not the best of artists. I however, have always marveled at these beautiful stickers in others’ packages and wished to create one myself.</description>
