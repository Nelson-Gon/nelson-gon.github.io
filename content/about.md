Nelson Gonzabato, known online as NelsonGon, is currently a third year Biomedical Sciences student at ZJU-UoE Institute. Over the duration of his degree, Nelson has developed interest in neuroscience and pharmacology and how computational tools could aid research in these areas. He has recently been fascinated by mixed effects models and how powerful these are and is also currently learning more about deep learning based approaches to biological image processing. 

Outside class, Nelson continually seeks ways of advancing his programming skills and knowledge. To do this, Nelson contributes frequently to the `R` tag on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon) where he has learnt a lot from some of the very best R programmers. You can find some of his answers by clicking on the image below:

To give back to the community, Nelson has authored a few open source packages and would love to hear from you about his work. You can find some of his work [here](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/). While he uses `R` a lot, Nelson is currently focusing on learning as much `python` and `bash` as possible. 

Thank you!
