Nelson Gonzabato (NelsonGon) is currently a final year BSc (Hons) and BSc Biomedical Sciences student at the University of Edinburgh and Zhejiang University,
respectively. He is pursuing both degrees at the joint Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute. 

This blog was started as a way to both document Nelson's learning process and share a few thoughts on the role of (open-source) programming in advancing science. The name "Biologically Plausible Programming" reflects Nelson's belief in building computational tools that are biologically inspired and relevant. 

Nelson has built several open-source computational tools including cytounet,
urlfix, and manymodelr. A full list of these tools can be found at https://nelson-gon.github.io/projects and source code browsed at https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/. 


Over the years, Nelson has also been an active member of the open source community,
frequently contributing to the `R` tag on StackOverflow. Some of his answers can be found at https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon.
