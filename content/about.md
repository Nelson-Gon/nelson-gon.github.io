Nelson Gonzabato, known online as NelsonGon, is currently a third year Biomedical Sciences student at the ZJU-UoE Institute. Over the duration of his degree, Nelson has developed interest in neuroscience and pharmacology and how computational tools could aid research in these areas, recently being fascinated by mixed effects models. He is currently exploring deep learning based approaches to biological image processing. 

Outside class, Nelson continually seeks ways of advancing his programming skills and knowledge. To this end, Nelson frequently contributes to the `R` tag on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon) where he has learnt from some of the very best R programmers.
