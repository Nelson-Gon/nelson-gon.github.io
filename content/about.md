Nelson Gonzabato, known online as NelsonGon, is currently a third year Biomedical Sciences student at the ZJU-UoE Institute. Over the duration of his degree, Nelson has developed interest in neuroscience and pharmacology and how computational tools could aid research in these areas, recently being fascinated by mixed effects models. He is currently exploring deep learning based approaches to biological image processing. 

Outside class, Nelson continually seeks ways of advancing his programming skills and knowledge. For this reason and partly as a way of giving back to the community, Nelson has authored a few open source packages including `manymodelr`, `cytounet`, and `mde` amongst others. A detailed list of his work is available [here](https://nelson-gon.github.io/projects). 

Nelson is currently proficient in `python`, `R`, and `bash` with Linux experience. Nelson also spends some time exploring current user issues especially in the `R` community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) where he is a frequent contributor. You can find some of his contributions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon?tab=answers) or by clicking the image below.

He also loves running, is a longtime Arsenal Football club supporter, and plays as a striker whenever he's not writing code or in class. He is more than happy to discuss any of these topics. 
Thank you for having read this far and visiting this site! Please [contact](https://nelson-gon.github.io/social) him if you have any suggestions and criticism.
