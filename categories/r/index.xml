      <description>This is the development version of mde. The acronym mde stands for Missing Data Explorer, a package that is intended to make missing data exploration as smooth and easy as possible.
The goal of mde is to ease exploration of missingness without feeling overwhelmed by syntax with particular focus on simplicity.

      <description>I have recently released new versions of manymodelr and mde, R packages you may or may not have heard of.
One common feature of many R packages is a hexagon shaped sticker that often summarises the goals of the package and/or gives an idea of the developer’s philosophy. I am, as those who know me well might tell you, not the best of artists. I however, have always marveled at these beautiful stickers in others’ packages and wished to create one myself.</description>

      <title>How to add a custom Kaggle Favicon to Hugo&#39;s Blackburn Theme</title>

      <description>In this short article, I show how I added a Kaggle favicon to the site.
Prerequisites:
R packages
  magrittr
  magick
  Why did I need to create a custom favicon?
I admittedly do not use Kaggle as much as I used to a year or so ago, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;ve found the site to be less enjoyable but that&amp;rsquo;s a post for another day.
The real reason for the need to create a custom icon was the desire to include Kaggle under the side bar.</description>
