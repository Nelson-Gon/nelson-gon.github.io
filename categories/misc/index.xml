      <description>I have recently released new versions of manymodelr and mde, R packages you may or may not have heard of.
One common feature of many R packages is a hexagon shaped sticker that often summarises the goals of the package and/or gives an idea of the developer’s philosophy. I am, as those who know me well might tell you, not the best of artists. I however, have always marveled at these beautiful stickers in others’ packages and wished to create one myself.</description>

      <description>In this short article, I show how I added a Kaggle favicon to the site.
Prerequisites:
R packages
  magrittr
  magick
  Why did I need to create a custom favicon?
I admittedly do not use Kaggle as much as I used to a year or so ago, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;ve found the site to be less enjoyable but that&amp;rsquo;s a post for another day.
The real reason for the need to create a custom icon was the desire to include Kaggle under the side bar.</description>
