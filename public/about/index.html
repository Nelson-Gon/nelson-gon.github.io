      <p>Nelson Gonzabato, known online as NelsonGon, is currently a third year Biomedical Sciences student at the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute. Over the duration of his degree, Nelson has developed interest in neuroscience and pharmacology and how computational tools could be used to aid research in these areas. Recently, he has been fascinated by mixed effects models and how powerful these are.</p>
<p>Outside class, Nelson continually seeks ways of advancing his programming skills and knowledge. To do this, Nelson contributes frequently to the <code>R</code> tag on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon">StackOverflow</a> where he has learnt a lot from some of the very best R programmers. Nelson has been lucky enough to contribute a few open source packages and would love to hear from you about his work. You can find some of his work <a href="https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/">here</a>. While he has spent a lot of time learning <code>R</code>, Nelson loves exploring and is currently learning as much <code>python</code> and <code>bash</code> as possible.</p>
<p>To contact Nelson about any of his work or provide research/internship opportunities, please reach out to him using any one of the links above. Alternatively, you can email him using the by running this one liner in a Terminal(Git Bash on Windows):</p>
