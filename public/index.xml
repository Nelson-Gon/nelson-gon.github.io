      <description>Nelson Gonzabato, known online as NelsonGon, is currently a third year Biomedical Sciences student at the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute. Over the duration of his degree, Nelson has developed interest in neuroscience and pharmacology and how computational tools could be used to aid research in these areas. Recently, he has been fascinated by mixed effects models and how powerful these are.
Outside class, Nelson continually seeks ways of advancing his programming skills and knowledge.</description>
