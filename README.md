# Biologically Plausible Programming 

This repository holds source files for Nelson Gonzabato's blog hosted at 
https://nelson-gon.github.io. 

The name Biologically Plausible Programming aims to reflect the idea that code written to solve biological problems should not only follow programming best practices and conventions but should also be biologically relevant.

In other words, the blog aims to host Nelson's thoughts on how the field of computational biology could advance biomedical research, producing tools that are directly relevant for basic research and possibly usable in the clinic. 

Thank you very much for reading. Nelson is always happy to hear from you regarding either potential training opportunities or feedback on his blogs.
