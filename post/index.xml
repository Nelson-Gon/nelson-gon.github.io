      <description>I have recently released new versions of manymodelr and mde, R packages you may or may not have heard of.
One common feature of many R packages is a hexagon shaped sticker that often summarises the goals of the package and/or gives an idea of the developer’s philosophy. I am, as those who know me well might tell you, not the best of artists. I however, have always marveled at these beautiful stickers in others’ packages and wished to create one myself.</description>

      <description>In this short post, we take a look at how we can use pyautocv for edge detection. At the time of writing, pyautocv was at version 0.2.1 that was unreleased.
For installation details, please see the documentation of the project.
Pre-requisites
Python &amp;gt;=3.6pyautocvAn image directory for which detection is required.To begin, we import pyautocv’s Segmentation class.
from pyautocv.segmentation import *Next, we change directory to the target directory that holds our images.</description>

      <description>In this short article, I show how I added a Kaggle favicon to the site.
Prerequisites:
R packages
  magrittr
  magick
  Why did I need to create a custom favicon?
I admittedly do not use Kaggle as much as I used to a year or so ago, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;ve found the site to be less enjoyable but that&amp;rsquo;s a post for another day.
The real reason for the need to create a custom icon was the desire to include Kaggle under the side bar.</description>
